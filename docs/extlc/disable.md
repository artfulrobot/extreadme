# Extension README

## Disable?

README information is displayed here for this and other extensions during extension management because of this very extension. Disabling this extenion will prevent these messages from being displayed.

The service that provides this functionality is extended to other extensions so that they may include documentation in their user interface. Disabling this extension will cause those documents to disappear as well.
